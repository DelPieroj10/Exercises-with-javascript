My name is Jean Piero Parra

I am a highly qualified professional with a Degree in Finance and Accounting and over seventeen years of experience in the areas of sales, management, accounting and merchandising within different industries. I also have been studying Graphic Design since the year 2020 and web development and English since 2022. 
Among the strengths I have developed are my excellent communication skills (that I have improved with a master in Neuro Linguistic Programming), attention to detail, teamwork, problem solving skills, strategic thinking, organized, training and being high skill in adapting to changes. I am almost completely bilingual, however I am able to communicate effectively with people from other countries and this has allowed me to connect with team work.
Now I am looking for a new challenge as a web developer. I would like to contribute with my qualifications and creativity in order to reach company goals.
